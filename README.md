# FCC-MachineLearningWithPython-CertifcationProjects
Submissions for freecodecamp.org's "Machine Learning with Python" certification projects

## Rock Paper Scissors
## Cat and Dog Image Classifier
[Starting Code](https://colab.research.google.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-cat-and-dog-image-classifier/blob/master/fcc_cat_dog.ipynb)/
Uses cat and dog image dataset to classify new images given to model as "cat" or "dog".

Skills gained from project:
- Using Keras ImageDataGenerator to create image generators to be used in models
- Image pre-processing and manipulating small image datasets to reduce overfitting
- Creating sequential convolutional neural networks
