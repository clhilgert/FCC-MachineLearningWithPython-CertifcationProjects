# FCC-MachineLearningWithPython-CertifcationProjects
Submissions for freecodecamp.org's "Machine Learning with Python" certification projects

## Rock Paper Scissors
## Cat and Dog Image Classifier
Uses cat and dog image dataset to classify new images given to model as "cat" or "dog".\

Skills gained from project:
- Using Keras ImageDataGenerator to create image generators to be used in models
- Image pre-processing and manipulating small image datasets to reduce overfitting
- Creating/structuring sequential convolutional neural networks\
